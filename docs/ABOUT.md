# About

Euphoria is a programming language with the following advantages over conventional languages:

## Euphoric

A remarkably simple, flexible, powerful language definition that is easy to learn and use.

## Dynamic

Variables grow or shrink without the programmer having to worry about allocating and freeing chunks of memory. Objects of any size can be assigned to an element of a Euphoria sequence (array).

## Fast

A high-performance, state-of-the-art interpreter that's significantly faster than conventional interpreters such as Perl and Python.

## Compiles

An optimizing Euphoria To C Translator, that can boost your speed even further, often by a factor of 2x to 5x versus the already-fast interpreter.

## Safe

Extensive run-time checking for: out-of-bounds subscripts, uninitialized variables, bad parameter values for library routines, illegal value assigned to a variable and many more. There are no mysterious machine exceptions--you will always get a full English description of any problem that occurs with your program at run-time, along with a call-stack trace-back and a dump of all of your variable values. Programs can be debugged quickly, easily and more thoroughly.

## High level

Features of the underlying hardware are completely hidden. Programs are not aware of word-lengths, underlying bit-level representation of values, byte-order etc.

## Debugger

A full-screen source debugger and an execution profiler are included.

## Editor

A full-screen, multi-file editor is also included. On a color monitor, the editor displays Euphoria programs in multiple colors, to highlight comments, reserved words, built-in functions, strings, and level of nesting of brackets. It optionally performs auto-completion of statements, saving you typing effort and reducing syntax errors. This editor is written in Euphoria, and the source code is provided to you without restrictions. You are free to modify it, add features, and redistribute it as you wish.

## Multi-platform

Euphoria programs run under Windows, Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and can be easily ported to any platform supporting GCC.

## Stand-alone

You can make a single, stand-alone executable file from your program.

## Generic

Euphoria routines are naturally generic. The example program below shows a single routine that will sort any type of data--integers, floating-point numbers, strings etc. Euphoria is not an "object-oriented" language, yet it achieves many of the benefits of these languages in a much simpler way.

## Free

Euphoria is completely free and open source. 

# Euphoria has come a long way since v1.0 was released in July 1993 by Rapid Deployment Software (RDS). There are now enthusiastic users around the world.
