# Tests

## From the command line
 
Simply type `eutest`. It is assumed that the path to the openeuphoria binaries has been declared in the PATH environment variable.

See [Unit Testing](https://openeuphoria.org/docs/eutest.html#_736_eutestunittesting) for comprehensive EUTEST documentation.
  
## Editing the t_*.e file
 
This is encouraged at the beginning of your journey. Insert a `--` before all but the first one or two tests. Save the test file. Write your code to solve the first test or two. Then progressively enable more tests until you can pass all of them.
